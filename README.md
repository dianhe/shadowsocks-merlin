ShadowSocks for Merlin
======================

This is a pre-compiled version of the latest shadowsocks version for Asus-Merlin firmware.

I've only tested the ss-server part as that's what I'm most interested in. Will work on the client part later 
(it's a bit more complex with iptables etc).

Simply clone the repository and copy everything to /opt once entware is setup.
